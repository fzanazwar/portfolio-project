# Predicting Machine Type Failure

This project is about predicting the type of machine failure based on certain environmental factors and operational settings of the machine using a machine learning model. The machine learning model with its optimised hyperparameters was successful in producing a high accuracy result and low false negatives.

## DATA
A summary of the data you’re using, remembering to include where you got it and any relevant citations. 

## MODEL 
A summary of the model you’re using and why you chose it. 

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
Description of which hyperparameters you have and how you chose to optimise them. 

## RESULTS
A summary of your results and what you can learn from your model
